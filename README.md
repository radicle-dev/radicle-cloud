# ðŸŒ± Radicle Cloud :cloud:

This repository includes the operator and the contracts you need to become a service provider for Radicle seed nodes.

## Contract

You can deploy ETH and ERC-20 based contracts located inside [contract](contract/) and then point your operator to your deployed contract. An example script is provided for you in [deploy.sh](contract/deploy.sh) which deploys [EthRadicleCloud.sol](contract/src/EthRadicleCloud.sol) to Arbitrum Rinkeby Testnet. You can change network by changing `ETH_RPC_URL`. You must have [dapp.tools](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools) installed.

**IMPORTANT:** replace `ETH_FROM` with your own wallet and make sure the key can be found in your local keystore. If you want to import a private key, use:

```
$ geth account import /path/to/private-key
```

Finally, make `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` point to your own deployed contract in `.env.operator`.

## Deploy Operator

You can deploy operator with Ansible after filling in your `.env.operator`, which you can sample from [`.env.sample`](.env.sample).

### SSH Key

Generate an SSH key for your operator, if you already don't have one, with:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519): cloud-operator
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in cloud-operator.
Your public key has been saved in cloud-operator.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:... user@host
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|                 |
|                 |
|       ...       |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Upload the pub key to your cloud, e.g. Hetzner and add the name (`HETNZER_SSH_NAME`) to your `.env.operator` file.


### Deploying

Make sure your private SSH key can be found locally in `~/.ssh/local_ssh_name` and that `LOCAL_SSH_PATH` in `.env.operator` file matches:

```
# .env.operator (truncated)
LOCAL_SSH_PATH=~/.ssh/cloud-operator
```

Finally:

```
$ ansible-playbook ansible/deploy-operator.yml --inventory=root@x.x.x.x, --private-key=~/.ssh/key-to-server --extra-vars="local_ssh_name=cloud-operator db_name=radicle db_user=postgres db_password=postgres"
```
